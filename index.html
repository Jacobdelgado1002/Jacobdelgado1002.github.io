<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    I am an <strong>undergraduate senior</strong> in 
    <a href="https://www.uprm.edu/cse/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the 
    <a href="https://www.uprm.edu/">University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I am particularly interested in research that focuses on the deployment of 
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to create meaningful social impact. 
    While AI has achieved groundbreaking advancements across various fields, 
    its reliance on high-performance computing resources has often limited its accessibility, 
    particularly in resource-constrained environments. This challenge presents a compelling opportunity 
    to explore how AI can be adapted for these settings such as developing healthcare diagnostic tools 
    optimized for rural and underserved areas. I am committed to exploring innovative techniques to optimize 
    AI models for deployment on embedded devices, including approaches like quantization and pruning.
</p>

<p>
    Looking ahead, my primary career goal is to pursue a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering. 
    This path will enable me to design and advance novel methodologies for AI compression and optimization, 
    contributing to systems that address pressing societal challenges. Beyond research, I am passionate 
    about education and aspire to join academia in Puerto Rico. By becoming a mentor and educator, I hope to 
    inspire and guide future generations of Puerto Rican students, fostering their curiosity and helping them 
    achieve academic success. Through this focus, I aim to create a lasting impact that bridges technological 
    advancements with tangible benefits for society.
